<!-- Describe the issue you're having here. -->

### Account type

If you use an email address or phone number, you have a Live (Microsoft) account.
Do mention if you have your Skype and Microsoft accounts linked, and which you're using to login.

### Conversation details

<!--
If your issue is specific to conversations or messages, include the affected chat types.
Conversations are either 1-to-1s or groups, with Skype or Skype for Business contacts.
Check in other clients (desktop and mobile) if a sent message is missing or rendered incorrectly.
If you have a SkypeMsg object, call `str()` on it to get a readable summary and include it below.
For embedded files or pictures in a message, please attach or link a sample.

### Steps to reproduce

<!--
Explain how to (reliably) recreate the issue.  A short code sample may be useful.
If applicable, test the corresponding action on https://web.skype.com to see if it works there.

### Result or traceback

<!--
Please set `SKPY_DEBUG_HTTP=1` in your environment to capture API requests to Skype's servers.
Include the relevant parts (not the entire output), ```enclosed in backticks``` for readability.
Make sure to *remove any personal information* such as passwords or tokens before posting.
