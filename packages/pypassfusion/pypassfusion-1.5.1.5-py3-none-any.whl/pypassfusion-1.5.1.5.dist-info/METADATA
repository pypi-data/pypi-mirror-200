### **PyPassFusion Documentation**
___

**Introduction**

I developed this password generating program using Python to provide users with a simple yet efficient way to:

- Generate a brand new password for any platform of their choosing.
- 
- Add already existing passwords.
- 
- Save all generated or customized passwords, along with the title of the platform they're being used on, as a text file at the user's specified destination.
- 
- You can then access your passwords by searching for this (.txt) file on your Windows/Linux or macOs system.


**Installation**

You can install this program by opening your Terminal and typing in â€œ`pip install pypassfusion` or `pip3 install pypassfusion`â€œ.

After installation is completed, you can start using it by simply typing in â€œpyfusionâ€‌ and hitting enter.


**Utilization**

You will then see this menu:

If you want to generate a new password, you will type in â€œ1â€œ and hit enter. the program will then ask you these 3 questions:

![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228978507-267adcc1-9d74-4894-a32a-bb4123f272c1.png)

After answering all of them to your preference, your password will be generated! then youâ€™ll be provided with the menu again:

![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228978646-4d88f055-675d-48cd-b6c0-aae5cda057d4.png)

If you want to see the generated password, you enter â€œ3â€œ:

![4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228978771-cf92350b-c26b-48d4-b33f-b2f7b0fec3ed.png)

If you want to save the generated password, you enter â€œ4â€œ:

![5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228978854-0fb5fc23-9350-4a70-b076-fdf7f0ae5654.png)

Here you choose a name for your (.txt) file and the path you have in mind for this file.

Then hit save:

![6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228978991-e8ee2bfb-78c7-42ec-9264-6260ec10a28a.png)

The last step is to choose a title for this specific password you just generated, for example: Gmail.

After that your new password will be successfully saved to its destination!

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979070-33f92aa4-fa8c-4c68-b023-76d869bba4aa.png)

You will then find this (.txt) file at its designated spot on your system:

![8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979144-ddfc8eeb-2e9f-4b29-a51a-1d37ddedcd91.png)

Any other password you add yourself or generate using the program can be either added to this existing file or a new one.

**here is how you can add your own password:**

First you need to choose option â€œ2â€œ

Here youâ€™ll see a sub-menu:

![9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979318-9a06ef56-07cb-4b8b-a33a-5c5a9a691c57.png)

You can type in your customized password by choosing option â€œ1â€œ.

![10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979398-97db7073-7496-43c4-94f6-62ffa610359d.png)

Your password has now been added, by choosing â€œ2â€œ you will see the password you just added and by choosing â€œ3â€œ you proceed to save your own password as a text file like so:

![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979487-740769c4-532e-4636-8f4e-f63ccff997ad.png)

![12](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979562-11f5c593-4fe4-4b9d-924d-d76efb9ae97b.png)
![13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979565-496cbc3a-f950-4501-a5a4-a073f0659e08.png)

This is what youâ€™ll then see in your previously made (.txt) file:

![14](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72671131/228979625-ac444c86-dfb1-4fb6-a926-d946056fa38b.png)

As you follow these steps and continue on using the program this list of passwords will expand.

And thatâ€™s it! hope you enjoy using this CLI. 

Also let me know if you have any suggestions or if youâ€™re interested in making a contribution.

**P.S   Iâ€™ll be adding the GUI of this program in the near future.**
