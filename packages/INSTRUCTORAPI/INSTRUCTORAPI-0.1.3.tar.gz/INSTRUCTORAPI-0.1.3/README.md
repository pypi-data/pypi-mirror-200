This repository has been created as a part of CMSE495: Experiential Learning in Data Science at Michigan Sate University. This course is the capstone for the data science major and provides the opportunity for students to work in teams on a sponsored project as a culmination of the skills they have learned. 

The sponsor for the D2L Instructor API project is Michigan State University. The goal of this project is to build a data analysis API for the learning management system to provide more intuitive, insightful, and accesible student performance data to researchers and instructors.
