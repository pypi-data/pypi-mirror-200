Canals is a **node orchestration engine**. Nodes are Python objects that can execute a task, like reading a file, performing calculations, or making API calls. Canals connects these objects together: it builds a graph of nodes and takes care of managing their execution order, making sure that each object receives the input it expects from the other nodes of the pipeline.

Canals powers version 2.0 of the [Haystack framework](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack).

## Installation

Running:

```console
pip install canals
```

gives you the bare minimum necessary to run Canals.

To be able to draw pipelines, please make sure you have [graphviz](https://graphviz.org/download/) installed:

```console
sudo apt install graphviz  # You may need `graphviz-dev` too: sudo apt install graphviz-dev
pip install canals[draw]
```
