    Primarily for use with [Select][frequenz.channels.util.Select].

    The timestamp generated is a timezone-aware datetime using UTC as timezone.

    Example:
        When you want something to happen with a fixed period:

        ```python
        timer = Timer(30.0)
        select = Select(bat_1 = receiver1, timer = timer)
        while await select.ready():
            if msg := select.bat_1:

                    process_data(val)
                else:
                    logging.warn("battery channel closed")
            if ts := select.timer:
                # something to do once every 30 seconds
                pass
        ```

        When you want something to happen when nothing else has happened in a
        certain interval:

        ```python
        timer = Timer(30.0)
        select = Select(bat_1 = receiver1, timer = timer)
        while await select.ready():
            timer.reset()
            if msg := select.bat_1:
                if val := msg.inner:
                    process_data(val)
                else:
                    logging.warn("battery channel closed")
            if ts := select.timer:
                # something to do if there's no battery data for 30 seconds
                pass
