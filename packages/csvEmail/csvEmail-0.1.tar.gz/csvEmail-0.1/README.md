# `csvEmail.py`

A simple script for sending mass emails based on a CSV file containing
email addresses plus per-recipient info and a template file containing
slots to be filled in from columns in the CSV file.

I've solved this problem too many times so I'm putting this script up
where others can use it and where I can find and install it easily.

Run `python3 csvEmail.py --help` for usage info.

## Changelog

- v0.1: Created based on the script I had been kicking around for a few
  semesters.
