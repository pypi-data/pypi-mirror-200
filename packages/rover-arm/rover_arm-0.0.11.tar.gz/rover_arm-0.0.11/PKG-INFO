A OpenAI Gym Env for Rover with Arm
Task - Move the cart near the table and pick up the object in the tray
Reward = 1 (when the object is picked up)
Reward = 0 (else)

Code with Sample Actions
```
import rover_arm
import gym
env = gym.make('rover-arm-v0', render_mode = 'rgb_array')

observation = env.reset()
done = False

while not done:
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    img = env.render()
    # print(img.shape)
    print(action, observation, reward)
    
print(reward, done, info)
```

Code to control the bot using keyboard in human mode (needs to be run in local)

```
import rover_arm.keyboard_control as kc

import rover_arm
import gym
env = gym.make('rover-arm-v0', render_mode = 'human')

keyboard_controller = kc.KeyboardAction()
keyboard_controller.start_listening()

observation = env.reset()
done = False

while not done:
    action = keyboard_controller.action
    observation, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
    # print(action, observation, reward)
# print(reward, done, info)
```
