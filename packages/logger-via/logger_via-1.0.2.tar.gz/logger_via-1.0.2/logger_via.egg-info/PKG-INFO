Description-Content-Type: text/markdown

# General Purpose
The package holds two decorators that can wrap a python function and save the details of it's execution
into a log. The details include the name of the function, args and kwargs and what did the function return.
This is achieved by means of redirecting stderr and stdout to a file or an email (depending on which
decorator is used)
	
@log - decorator save the log into a file. A relative path: 'output/log.txt' is used by default. Does not require
preliminary setup in "config.py" unless another output directory wanted.

@email_log - decorator send the log by email. The usage require SMTP server to be configured at "config.py".
	
# Package Composition
### config.py
The setup and configuration file with constants used in the logger. 

    LOG_FILE:     The path to a log saved by @log decorator. 'output/log.txt' is used by default.

    SENDER:       The sender's email will be displayed in the From: field (in the body of the letter).

    PASSWORD:     SMTP password (received from SMTP server. Frequently - a sender's password)
