              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

Serdio
===========

Automatic serialization of function inputs and outputs using MessagePack.

## Why Serdio?
Remotely executing Python code is complicated. A common pattern is to wrap the code into a function that maps serialized data to serialized data, however this leads to heavy amounts of boilerplate related to serialization of native and custom Python types.

Serdio makes this easy by handling this serialization boilerplate for you as much as possible. For any custom types, it only requires the user to provide a encoder/decoder helpers that break the types down into Python-native components. An example can be found <a href="#using-serdio-with-custom-types">below</a>.

## Installation

```sh
pip install serdio
```

## Usage

### Basic
Here, we use Serdio to lift a function that performs some simple math on native Python numbers.
```python
@serdio.lift_io
def my_cool_function(x: int, y: float, b: float = 1.0) -> float:
    z = x * y
    z += b
    return z

bytes_handler: Callable[bytes, bytes] = my_cool_function.as_bytes_handler()

z = my_cool_function(2, 3.0)
assert z == 7.0
```

Now we can use the `bytes_handler` function on Serdio-encoded bytes:

```python
xyb_bytes = serdio.serialize(2, 3.0, b=2.0)
zbytes = bytes_handler(xyb_bytes)

z = serdio.deserialize(zbytes)
assert z == 8.0
```

### Using Serdio with Custom Types
In this example, we reproduce the above example with custom types `MyCoolClass` and `MyCoolResult`, instead of native Python numbers.
To give Serdio a little guidance, we provide helper functions that can convert our custom types  into Python native values and back (`my_cool_encoder` and `my_cool_decoder`).

The resulting function can operate on our custom types, while Serdio automatically applies the encoder/decoder helpers to function inputs and outputs.

```python
@dataclasses.dataclass
class MyCoolResult:
    cool_result: float

    def shift(self, other: float) -> MyCoolResult:
        return MyCoolResult(self.cool_result + other)

@dataclasses.dataclass
class MyCoolClass:
    cool_int: float
    cool_float: int

    def mul(self) -> MyCoolResult:
        return MyCoolResult(self.cool_int * self.cool_float)

def my_cool_encoder(x):
    if dataclasses.is_dataclass(x):
        return {
            "__type__": x.__class__.__name__,
            "fields": dataclasses.asdict(x)
        }
    return x

def my_cool_decoder(obj):
    if "__type__" in obj:
        obj_type = obj["__type__"]
        if obj_type == "MyCoolClass":
            return MyCoolClass(**obj["fields"])
        elif obj_type == "MyCoolResult":
            return MyCoolResult(**obj["fields"])
    return obj

@serdio.lift_io(encoder_hook=my_cool_encoder, decoder_hook=my_cool_decoder)
def my_cool_function(a: MyCoolClass, b: float = 1.0) -> MyCoolResult:
    x: MyCoolResult = a.mul()
    return x.shift(b)

my_handler = my_cool_function.as_bytes_handler()

a = MyCoolClass(2, 3.0)
ab_bytes = serdio.serialize(a, b=2.0, encoder=my_cool_function.encoder)
c_bytes = my_handler(ab_bytes)
c = serdio.deserialize(c_bytes, my_cool_function.decoder)

assert c == my_cool_function(a, b=2.0)
print(c.cool_result)
# 8.0
```
