mailadm
=======

mailadm is an administration tool for creating and removing e-mail accounts
(especially temporary accounts) on a `mailcow <https://mailcow.email/>`_ mail
server. This makes creating an email account as easy as scanning a QR code.

The general idea of how it works:

1. Admins generate an "account creation token", which can be displayed as a QR
   code
2. A soon-to-be user uses an email client to scan the QR code, which sends a
   web request to mailadm
3. mailadm creates the account and sends the password to the Delta Chat app,
   the user is automatically logged in to the new account
