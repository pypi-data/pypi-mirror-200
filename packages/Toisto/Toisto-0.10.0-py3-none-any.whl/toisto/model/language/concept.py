    Concepts can be composites, meaning they consists of subconcepts (called constituent concepts). For example, a noun
    concept may have a singular and plural form. These forms are represented as constituent concepts of the parent
    concept. The parent and constituent attributes keep track of these relations.

    Another relation type that may exist between concepts is roots. Compound concepts such as 'blackboard' contain two
    roots, 'black' and 'board'. The concept for the compound concept refers to its roots with the roots attribute. The
    roots relation can also be used for sentences, in which case the individual words of a sentence are the roots.

    The antonym relation is used to capture opposites. For example 'bad' has 'good' as antonym and 'good' has 'bad'
    as antonym.

    NOTE: This class keeps track of the related concepts using their concept identifier (ConceptId) and only when
    the client asks for a concept is the concept instance looked up in the concept registry (Concept.instances). This
    prevents to the need for a second pass after instantiating concepts from the topic files to create the relations.
