# Autoencoder Market Models (AEMM)

## Overview

This package implements autoencoder-based models in Q- and P-measure.
The initial set of models is for interest rates. More asset classes
may be added at a later date.

The package takes specialized autoencoders and classical methods for performing dimension
reduction in quant models of financial markets from `aenc` package (https://pypi.org/project/aenc/).


## Quick Start Guide

Install using:

```shell
pip install aemm
```

## Namespaces

Namespace `aemm.core` implements autoencoder-based market models (AEMM)
and related classical models.

The implementation uses PyTorch and can be easily ported to TensorFlow 2
and other machine learning frameworks that support dynamic computational
graphs.

Namespace `aemm.dummy` includes dummy objects and generators for dummy market
data for testing purposes. To perform testing or training on real
historical or market-implied data, provide your own data files in the same
format as the dummy data files, or use pretrained components.

Namespace `aemm.pretrained` includes pretrained components to avoid lengthy
test execution time. Use flags to ignore pretrained parameters
and perform training from scratch (calculation time will increase).
