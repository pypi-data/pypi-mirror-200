# LLR-Evaluation (llreval)

This is an authorized fork from [PYLLR](https://github.com/bsxfan/PYLLR).

Python toolkit for likelihood-ratio calibration of binary classifiers.

The emphasis is on binary classifiers (for example speaker verification), where the output of the classifier is in the form of a well-calibrated log-likelihood-ratio (LLR). The tools include:
- PAV and ROCCH score analysis.
- DET curves and EER
- DCF and minDCF
- Bayes error-rate plots
- Cllr

Most of the algorithms in LLR-Evaluation are Python translations of the older MATLAB [BOSARIS Tookit](https://sites.google.com/site/bosaristoolkit/). Descriptions of the algorithms are available in:

> Niko Brümmer and Edward de Villiers, [The BOSARIS Toolkit: Theory, Algorithms and Code for Surviving the New DCF](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.2865), 2013.

## Install

Install using `pip`
```sh
pip install llreval
```

## Usage

```python
import llreval
```

## Out of a hundred trials, how many errors does your speaker verifier make?
We have included in the examples directory, some code that reproduces the plots in our paper:

> Niko Brümmer, Luciana Ferrer and Albert Swart, "Out of a hundred trials, how many errors does your speaker verifier make?", 2011, https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00732.
