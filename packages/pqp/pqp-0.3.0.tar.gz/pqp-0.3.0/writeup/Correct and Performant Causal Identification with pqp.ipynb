    "# Abstract\n",
    "Causal inference under Pearl’s framework of structural causal models has been the subject of intense theoretical study, but performant open-source implementations of many of the key algorithms are still lacking or, where they exist, are not widely adopted or maintained. I present `pqp` (short for *Pourquoi-pas?*), a performant implementation of Shpitser’s IDC algorithm for identification of conditional causal effects in semi-Markovian causal models. The library includes sophisticated memory-sharing graph data structures, a symbolic simplification routine, and it comes wrapped in an elegant Python interface."

    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal inference is a fundamental task in many fields, including epidemiology, economics, and data science. One popular framework for causal inference is Pearl's structural causal modeling framework, which utilizes directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and the do-calculus to explicitly model potential causal relationships. (Pearl, 2000) This approach allows for a clear and intuitive representation of causal assumptions, while also helping to avoid common biases that can arise with other methodologies. However, a crucial step in this framework is identification: translating a causal question into an abstract statistical estimator that can be estimated using a combination of a model and parametric assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important algorithm for identification in the structural causal modeling framework is Shpitser's algorithm for conditional interventional effects. (Shpitser, 2008) This algorithm is polynomial time and guarantees a result when one is possible. However, existing open-source implementations of this algorithm are often incorrect, slow, or unmaintained. In this paper, I present a novel implementation of Shpitser's algorithm, written in Rust for efficient cross-functional use. Our implementation is production-quality code and includes extensive testing routines to ensure performance and correctness.\n",
    "\n",
    "To bridge the gap between theoretical algorithm and practical tool, I developed two techniques as subroutines to the algorithm. I developed and implemented a heuristic symbolic simplification algorithm. To protect the speed and memory efficiency of the program, I designed a memory-sharing graph datastructure which allows similar graphs to share memory via a system of references and immutable data. Further, I am close to finishing an implementation of a estimation technique which will extend the work in Brule (2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "To aid in adoption of this algorithm, I designed and implemented a user-friendly Python wrapper. This wrapper allows for the specification and visualization of causal graphs using a concise and elegant API, as well as giving the user full access to the underlying algorithms. This is available as a Python package on PyPi, and I created a website with documentation."

    "## Structural Causal Models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Structural Causal Models (SCM) provide a framework for modeling the generating process of a distribution. A structural causal model has four components: a set of observed variables $\\textbf{V} = {v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}$, a set of unobserved variables $\\textbf{U} = {u_1, u_2, ..., u_m}$, a distribution $P(U)$ over unobserved variables, and a set of functions $\\textbf{F} = {f_1, f_2...f_n}$ such that each $f_i$ is a function from a subset of $\\textbf{U} \\cup \\textbf{V} \\backslash V_i$ to $v_i$. The arguments to $f_i$ are called the parents of $v_i$ or $pa(v_i)$ and they uniquely determine the value of $v_i$. Together, $P(\\textbf{U})$ and $\\textbf{F}$ induce $P(\\textbf{V})$, a distribution over $\\textbf{V}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We represent the causal assumptions in an SCM via a causal diagram. This is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) where each node corresponds to a variable in the model. A directed edge from $x_i$ to $x_j$ indicates that the value of $x_j$ depends on the value of $x_i$, or $x_i \\in pa(x_j)$. To ensure the validity of an SCM, we restrict the set of valid models to those that can be represented by acyclic graphs, to prevent circular definitions between variables [1]. Algebraically, we can interpret a causal diagram as defining a set of conditional independence assumptions. In particular, as the parents of $v_i$ completely determine its value, $v_i$ will be independent of every other variable in the model, conditional on its parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note the acyclicity assumption does not restrict the class of distributions that can be represented by an SCM because by the definition of joint probability any joint distribution $P(x_1, x2…x_n)$ can be factorized as $P(x_1 | x_2…x_n)P(x_2 | x_3…x_n)...P(x_n-1 | x_n) P(x_n)$. But, this can be represented as an SCM where $pa(x_i) = \\{x_{i+1}, x_{i+2}…x_n\\}$ without violating the acyclicity assumption. However, the any given causal graph may be consistent with only a subset of all possible distributions over the variables in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of this paper, we make the additional assumption that each unobserved variable is the parent of at most two observed variables. This simplifies the graphical representation by replacing each unobserved variable and its outgoing edges with a single undirected edge connecting its two children. This can be interpreted as representing potential confounding between the two variables. An example of such a simplified graph is shown in Figure 1."

    "### Conditional Independence Properties of Causal Diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key properties of causal diagrams is that they can provide insight into the conditional independence properties of a distribution $P(\\textbf{U} \\cup \\textbf{V})$. As previously discussed, a variable $v_i$ is independent of all other variables in the model, conditional on its parents. This concept of a \"flow of dependence\" along edges connecting a node to its parent is a useful tool for understanding the conditional independence assumptions encoded in a causal diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is important to note that dependence does not flow along every path in the diagram. Paths can be blocked by conditioning on certain variables, which alters the conditional independence properties of the distribution. We can view a path as a collection of vertices, each of which must have one of the following forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$X \\leftarrow Y \\leftarrow Z$$\n",
    "$$X \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow Z$$\n",
    "$$X \\leftarrow Y \\rightarrow Z$$\n",
    "$$X \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow Z$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first three cases, dependence will flow through the vertex as long as we do not condition on $Y$. In this case, we call the vertex unblocked. Conditioning on $Y$ blocks the path and prevents dependence from traveling along it. This means that, as long as this is the only path connecting $X$ and $Y$, the causal diagram is predicting that $X$ and $Z$ will be independent conditional on $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third case, known as a collider, is slightly different. The last vertex will be unblocked if and only if we condition on $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the concept of colliders, consider the example of college admissions. Without knowledge of whether a student was admitted, learning her SAT scores tells us nothing about her admissions essays. However, if we know that the student was admitted, and we observe that her SAT scores were low, we can infer that her essays must have been good.\n",
    "\n",
    "A path is considered blocked if any vertex along it is blocked. If, after conditioning on a set of variables $\\textbf{Z}$, there are no unblocked paths connecting two variables $v_i$ and $v_j$, then the model predicts that $v_i$ and $v_j$ are independent conditional on $\\textbf{Z}$. In this case, we say that $v_i$ and $v_j$ are d-separated by $\\textbf{Z}$. This concept of d-separation provides a means to connect the ideas of statistical association in the joint distribution with properties of the graph, and allows us to use graphical models of causal relationships to make testable predictions about datasets."

    "### Graph Surgery and Causal Effects\n",
    "\n",
    "In causal inference, a fundamental task is to measure the causal effect of one set of variables, $X$, on another, $Y$. To operationalize this task within the Structural Causal Model (SCM) framework, we utilize the concept of interventions. Specifically, in the SCM, the values of $X$ are determined by its parents, $pa(X)$. However, we are interested in understanding the effect of altering the value of $X$ through intervention, rather than allowing it to be set by its natural causes. To model this intervention process, we perform \"graph surgery\" by cutting all incoming edges into $X$, and examining the resulting interventional distribution. This allows us to isolate any remaining conditional effect of $X$ on $Y$, which can then be interpreted as a causal effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "To gain further insight into this process, we can consider two types of paths that may connect $X$ and $Y$: backdoor paths and frontdoor paths. Backdoor paths are those that connect to $X$ through its parents, while frontdoor paths connect through its children. These paths represent different mechanisms through which $X$ may affect $Y$; frontdoor paths indicate direct causal effects, while backdoor paths indicate indirect effects through other variables (i.e. confounding). By performing graph surgery and cutting all backdoor paths, we effectively isolate any causal effects flowing through frontdoor paths.\n"

    "In the Structural Causal Model (SCM) framework, causal queries are represented by the use of the \"do-operator.\" The do-operator is indicated by its placement behind the conditioning bar in a probability expression, and it represents a modification of the underlying generating process. To illustrate, for sets of variables $X$, $Y$, and $Z$, the expression $P(Y | do(X), Z)$ represents the conditional probability $P(Y | X, Z)$ in the model that results from performing graph surgery on $X$. This represents a hypothetical scenario in which $X$ is fixed through intervention, rather than being determined by \"nature.\" A \"do-expression\" is any probability expression containing the do-operator.\n",

The do-calculus provides conditions under which do-operators can be removed from an expression or replaced with conditioning. This is advantageous because it allows us to transform do-expressions, which cannot be estimated from the data, into traditional statistical estimands (e.g., $P(Y | X, Z)$), which can be estimated using parametric assumptions.\n",

Additionally, because identification does not make any parametric assumptions about the data, it allows us to decouple our causal assumptions from our parametric assumptions during modeling."

    "### The Four Stages of Causal Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured causal effect estimation is a four-step process consisting of modeling, identification, estimation, and robustness checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modeling: This step involves identifying plausible causal relationships in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The DAG serves as a representation of the causal structure of the system being studied.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identification: Once the causal structure is represented in the form of a DAG, the next step is to translate a causal query into an abstract estimator in the context of these assumptions. This process is known as identification, and it is a crucial step in the process of causal inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Estimation: After the abstract estimator has been derived, the next step is to add parametric assumptions and pick a specific model to represent the abstract estimator. This model is then fitted to the data, and an estimate of the causal effect is extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Robustness checks: The final step is to assess the robustness of the analysis to the specifics of the assumptions made in the modeling process. This is done by perturbing the assumptions of the modeling process and determining the sensitivity of the analysis to these perturbations. These robustness checks are important for ensuring the validity and generalizability of the causal estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the modeling, identification, estimation and robustness checks are interrelated, and that making progress in one step may require revisiting the others."

    "\n",
    "It is important to note that not every causal estimand can be unambiguously estimated in every model. Identification, or the process of determining the causal estimand from the joint distribution, may fail when it is impossible to unambiguously determine $P(Y | do(X))$ from $P$. Identification is always possible in a graph with no confounding, but in some cases it is not possible because it is not possible to disentangle the effect from possible confounding. For example, in a model with a bidirected edge between variables, it may be impossible to identify $P(Y | do(X))$ because any observed effect could be explained by confounding along the bidirected edge, and there is no way to control for this."

    "The rules of the do-calculus provide complete conditions for identification of causal estimands; if it is possible to convert the causal estimand to a statistical estimand, then it is possible using the do-calculus. However, manually applying the rules of the do-calculus to derive an abstract estimator is time-consuming and requires the researcher to make reference to complex properties of the causal graph, which is a task humans are ill-suited to, especially as the complexity of the graph grows. In the general case, it is too complex a task to be performed by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, it is necessary to find algorithms by which identification can be performed automatically. This is a nontrivial problem; naive approaches often have exponential time complexity in the size of the graph, and the best algorithms, while polynomial time, rest on complex graph theory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some researchers have simplified this problem by sidestepping direct application of the do-calculus and instead using the concept of adjustment sets. These methods rely on finding a set of variables which, when controlled for, block all backdoor-paths from the intervention set to the outcome set. However, these approaches face two distinct challenges. First, naive approaches to adjustment set search, such as those implemented in Knupple (2010), Breitling (2010), and Sharma (2020) rely on enumerating the set of all possible adjustment sets and then checking whether each successfully blocks all backdoor paths. This is an issue because the number of possible adjustment sets grows exponentially in the number of nodes in the graph. This makes these approaches infeasible for even fairly small graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "More efficient algorithms exist for adjustment set search, such as the one proposed in Textor and Liskiewicz (2011), which works in polynomial time. However, the drawback of these algorithms is that although every valid adjustment set corresponds to a valid statistical estimator for the query, not every valid statistical estimator can be represented as an adjustment set. Because these algorithms are only searching among adjustment sets, they fail in cases where other classes of estimator are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate, in the famous front-door model, the interventional distribution $P(Y | do(X))$ is identified by the simple statistical estimator $P(Y | do(X)) = \\sum_z P(Z | X) \\sum_x P(Y | Z, X) P(X)$. This estimator works by breaking the problem into two subproblems: first identifying the interventional distributions $P(M | do(X))$ and $P(Y | do(M))$ and then combining these to identify $P(Y | do(X))$. Each subproblem can be solved using an adjustment set operator, but there is no adjustment set estimator which identifies $P(Y | do(X))$."

    "Front-door estimation is an interesting technique, but it also illustrates a larger concept in causal inference known as c-component factorization. C-components, or connected components, are subsets of the graph that are connected via bidirectional (confounding) edges. Two nodes, $A$ and $B$, in a causal graph are in the same c-component if and only if there is a path from $A$ to $B$ that only follows bidirectional edges. It has been shown that any causal graph can be uniquely partitioned into a minimal set of c-components (Tian, 2002).\n",

    "More importantly, Tian (2002) showed that for any c-component $C$ in a graph $G$, the interventional distribution $P(C | do(V \\backslash C))$ is identifiable, where $V$ denotes the set of nodes in $G$ and $\\backslash$ represents set difference. This means that the problem of identifying $P(Y | do(X))$ can be broken down into a set of subproblems, one for each c-component in the graph $G \\backslash X$. This is the first critical insight that enables efficient identification and is known as c-component factorization.\n",

Additionally, there is a single node $Y$ that has no children. If there are multiple nodes with no children, these nodes are referred to as the root-set of $G$, and the graph is called a c-forest."

    "The first three lines set up the algorithm. Line one is a base-case for identifiability. Lines two and three perform simplification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Line four works by breaking up the identification problem into subproblems. Considering the subgraph $G’ = G \\setminus X$, we find the c-components $\\{s_i\\}$ of $G’$. If there is more than one, then we can identify $P(Y | do(X))$ by finding the interventional distribution $P(s_i | do(G \\ s_i))$ for each $s_i$. Because of c-component factorization, we know that all such terms will be identifiable if and only if $P(Y | do(X))$ is identifiable. We can then take the product of all such terms to get a joint interventional distribution over the nodes in $G’$. By marginalizing all variables other than those in $X$ and $Y$, we can identify the interventional distribution.\n",
    " \n",
    "After repeated application of the above step, we will be in a position where $G’$ consists of a single c-component. There are three possible ways in which $X$ could relate to $G’$. $X$ and $G’$ could together form a single c-component. In this case, we have discovered a hedge, proving the interventional distribution is not identifiable (line 5). There could be no bidirectional edges connecting elements of $G’$ to elements of $X$. In this case, there are no backdoor paths from $X$ to $G’$ and we can identify the interventional distribution by conditioning on $X$ (line 6). It could be that some elements $Z \\subset X$ are connected via bidirectional edges to elements in $G’$, while others $W \\subset X$ are not. In this case, we can condition on $W$ and make a recursive call to the algorithm, attempting to identify the interventional distribution $P(G’ | do(Z))$ (line 7).\n",
    " \n",
    "The algorithm as described so far can only deal with queries of the form $P(Y | do(X))$, but often we will wish to calculate conditional interventional effects of the form $P(Y | do(X), Z)$. Thankfully, queries of this form can be mapped to queries without a conditional term with only a minimal transformation. This modification of the algorithm is known as IDC, or ID with conditioning, and it eliminates conditional variables in two ways. The first way is using Rule 22 of the do-calculus: if a conditional variable $z \\in Z$ has no back door paths to $Y$ when conditioning on $X$ and $Z \\ z$, then conditioning on z is equivalent to intervening on it, and it can be put inside the do operator. The second way is to treat $z$ as an outcome, run the algorithm, and then condition on $z$. Together, these two techniques can be used to eliminate all conditional variables from the query."

    "A number of open source implementations of the ID algorithm existed prior to my work. Dowhy is a popular python library developed by Microsoft Research, but its implementation is too slow. Researchers working on the dowhy project explicitly asked me to create a faster implementation and integrate it with their library. There is also an implementation in Clojure called Whittemore which is quite fast, but because Clojure is a JVM language it is not possible to integrate this implementation with Python, R, or Javascript code. I based my implementation on Whittemore. Ananke is a causal inference library developed by Shpitser’s team, and it has an implementation of a related algorithm, but Ananke has not seen widespread adoption, and it is unmaintained. FInally, the Javascript/R tool Daggity has an implementation of adjustment set operators, which suffer from the drawbacks discussed above."

    "\n",
    "### Graph Representation and Subroutines\n",
    "As a prerequisite to the rest of the work I did for this project, I implemented a set of graph routines to capture key operations that need to be performed during the algorithm. The key operations here are c-component factorization and ancestor search. C-component factorization is breaking partitioning the graph $G$ into subgraphs $S_i$ that obey the following constraints. Any two nodes ${a, b} \\subset S_i$ there exists a path from $a$ to $b$ along bidirectional edges, and for any two nodes $c \\in S_i$ and $d \\in S_j$ if $i \\ne j$ then there does not exist such a path. Ancestor search is the problem of finding the set $An(y)$ for a nodes $y$ such that a node $w$ is a member of $An(y)$ if and only if there is a directed path from $w$ to $y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of of these operations only requires access to one kind of edge (directed or bidirected), I model a causal graphical model as consisting of two graphs: one directional and one bidirectional. The directional graph data structure handles ancestor queries, and the bidirectional graph data structure handles c-component factorization. Each of these problems is trivially solvable in $O(E)$ (order of number of edges in the graph) using breadth-first search. The subtlety here is because of the way the algorithm recursively parititons the graph into subproblems, we will be repeatedly rerunning ancestor and c-components queries on slightly modified versions of the graph. The causal graph data structure needs to efficiently handle arbitrary series of the following four operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- c-component queries\n",
    "- ancestor queries\n",
    "- graph surgery (maintaining a copy of the original graph)\n",
    "- node deleletion (maintaining a copy of the original graph)\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, lines 2 and 3 of the algorithm require ancestor queries, and in the case of line 3, this query is performed after surgey. Lines 4 and 5 require c-component queries, and line 4 requires first removing $x$ from $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a structure representing the original graph must be maintained through deletions, we cannot just apply these as mutable changes to the data structure. So, a naive approach would be to make a copy of the graph at each modification and run the queries on this copied graph. This is quite wasteful from a resource standpoint though because it requires a linear-time $O(N + E)$ copy operation (order of number of nodes plus number of edges) at each modification. Since the algorithm has a worst case recursion-depth of $O(N)$, this amounts to an an additional quadratic order $O(N^2 + NE)$ runtime cost. The more concerning term here is the $NE$, because number of edges can grow with $O(N^2)$, so this term could be cubic. Although this is unlikely to be an issue in manually-specified models, it could become a real problem is models derived via automated causal discovery (e.g. in geothermal or econometric datasets) or in bioinfomatics applications, where causal networks are used to study genetic data, and models can get quite complicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address this problem, I implemented a set of routines that allows small modifications to be performed to the original graphs in such a way that a new data structure is created which is logically distinct inside the program but which uses most of the same memory. This reduces the memory footprint of the algorithm as well as reducing time spent copying data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of copying the causal graph when subgraphing, the data structure maintains a reference to the original graph, and each subgraph tracks the nodes which it currently contains and the nodes which have been the subject of surgery. It is still possible to perform c-component and ancestors queries with the same time complexity. This requires a $O(N)$ operation, but it avoids the especially costly $O(NE)$ term in the final time complexity."

    "### Simplification\n",
    "Simplification is an important step in computational identification because the ID algorithm tends to return symbolic expressions that are quite complex and require simplification. The complexity of these outputs is not indicative of the complexity of the \"answer\", but they tend to contain many elements which are algebraically redundant. E.g., frequently identical terms will appear in the numerator and denominator of a quotient. A few lines of mathematical manipulation can reduce the complexity of these expressions significantly, but it is a nontrivial problem to write a program that can do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to simplify the results for a couple of reasons. Simpler expressions are easier for humans to understand. They make it easier to test the program because they reduce the number of “correct” answers to an identification problem. And, maybe most importantly, simpler expressions are easier to evaluate numerically. It is both computationally cheaper and more accurate to simplify an expression before applying numerical estimation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whittemore, which I have borrowed from extensively, uses a heuristic-based simplification algorithm with just a couple of rules. My original plan was to just use this, but their algorithm contains idiosyncracies that I think may indicate a mathematical error. I plan to present an example failure case in the next iteration of this report.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tikka and Karvanen (2017) describe a simplification routine that uses properties of the graphical model to find ways to reduce conditional terms. I was originally optimistic about this approach as it has nice guarantees on the degree of simplification. However, this approach has a time complexity that gorws significantly faster than exponential in the number of variables, and so would not prove practical for real problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of relying on these solutions, I developed my own heuritsitc simplification algorithm. This algorithm relis on an observation that most of the redundancy in the estimands generated by the algorithm can be remedied by fairly simple algebra. I implemented a simple recursive algorithm that applies a series of transformations on elements in the symbolic expression. It traverses the expression tree, replacing each node with a simplified version.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each possible type of subexpression, the following transformations are applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "expression type | transformations | example | example (simplified)\n",
    "---|---|---|---\n",
    "Quotient | Merge nested quotients and products. Cancel identical terms. | ${P(a)(P(b)P(c)) \\over {P(b) \\over P(d))}}$ | $P(a)P(c)P(d)$\n",

    "\n",
    "This scheme has the disadvantage that no conditional probability expressions are left in the final result, which can make the formulas less readable. But, this is worth it because in quotient form it is much easier to identify redundant terms and cancel them. So, the formulas end up simpler on balance."

I have implemented a feature that allows for parametric modeling and causal estimation on statistical quantities. This feature is implemented as part of the Python wrapper.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, estimation of useful quantities from identified estimands can be quite hard because they involve a large number of nested sums (or integrals, in the continuous case). The computational complexity of evaluating nested sums grows exponentially in the number of these sums, and there is no way to reduce this cost in the general case while still computing an exact value.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many approaches to this problem. A number of numerical approximation tools have been developed in the field of Bayesian statistics, but these a often quite finicky and most are heavy weight solutions. Shpitser (2012) shows how the conditional independence properties of causal graphs can be exploited to reduce the practical difficulty, but their algorithm is still exponential time. Bhattacharya et. al. (2021) used a variety of sampling techniques, but this is a heavyweight solution, and although the estimators they propose are doubly-robust, they still require fitting a number of intermediate linear models which carry undesirable parametric assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the complex tradeoffs between algorithms and difficulty of implementation, I have chosen to extend Brule (2018) and implement a brute-force solution. Brule's estimator relies on directly calculating the sums, and as such remains completely non parametric and is tractable for small number of variables. Brule assumes that all variables in the model are discrete, which is needed for the brute-force approach, so to extend to the continuous case I plan to use quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the computational difficulties, a further, slightly more subtle, difficulty has to do with the *positivity*. All useful estimators identified by ID will have conditional probability terms, and these remained defined only when the conditioning variable can be guaranteed to have positive probability in the model. Brule (2018) uses a maximum likelihood multinomial estimator, which does not guarantee positivity. To get around this issue, I use a Bayesian multinomial estimator with a Dirichlet prior, which does guarantee positivity."

    "One problem with a large number of existing statistical software is that users often approach these tools with little udnerstanding of how they work or what exactly they are doing. This can lead to two main classes of issues: (1) users may not understand the assumptions that are being made by the software and thus fail to understand the limitation of an analysis, and (2) users may feel disempowered or \"out of the loop\". If the options are to either use a tool blindly or to dig into the source code or a dense textbook, then the former is often the more attractive option.\n",

But, in the context of causal inference, the goal is to make causal claims, and so there is no easily accessible ground truth against which to check the results. Additionally, many of the assumptions made in causal inference are often numerous and complex, and so users cannot be expected to know (or necessarily understand) them.\n",

This allows the user to inspect the steps actually performed by the library during an analysis and understand the assumptions that are being made.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this technically, I implemented a `Result` class which stores the outputs of key computations, such as data preprocessing, model fitting, identification, and estimation. A higher order function (called `entrypoint` in the code) wraps the key subroutines which perform these calculations. When they are called, it dynamically captures inputs to these functions, saving them for reproducability or sensitivity analysis. It then searches the inputs for any instances of `Result` and, if found, adds these as dependencies of the current calculation. Then, it wraps the output of these functions in a `Result` which can access information about its logical dependencies. In addition, the subroutines report any transformations or assumptions they make, and these are captured by `entrypoint` and included in the metadata inside `Result`. As such, any `Result` object can be used to reconstruct the entire analysis up to that point, and it knows all the assumptions underlying it.\n",

    "The Rust code underlying the library is extremely fast, but Rust is a language used by few in the causal inference community. To make the library more accessible, I created a Python library that wraps the Rust code. Although Python is definitely second to R in terms of adoption in the community, it is much more common among industrial practicioners.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the focus of the Rust implementation is correctness and performance, the focus of the Python bindings is on elegance and usability. I used Python's magic methods to create an API for specifying and querying causal models that is extremely simple and readable. I created a website with documentation for the python library, and I have published the library on PyPI.\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing Python's infix operators, I was able to create an API in which graphs can be created via an intuitive embedded syntax. It is possible to create a new causal model using the library in just a few lines. The `<=` operator creates a directed edge in the graph, while the `&` operator creates a bidirected edge. See the following example, which implements the front-door model."

    "My two top goals for the implementation were correctness and performance, and my top goal for the python wrapper was usability. I have characterized the correctness by using hand-derived examples from the literature. I have done some work to characterize performance using computational complexity, and I am working towards performance benchmarks. I hope to better understand the usability of my interface by interacting with it in the next few weeks."
