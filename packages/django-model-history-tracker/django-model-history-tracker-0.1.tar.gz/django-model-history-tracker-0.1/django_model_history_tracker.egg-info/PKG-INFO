Description: # Django Model History Tracker
        
        Django Model History Tracker is a utility that tracks changes to model instances and saves the history of updates. This can be helpful for auditing purposes or for generating reports about changes over time.
        
        ## Features
        
        - Track creation, update, and deletion of model instances
        - Store historical data in a separate `History` model
        - Easy integration with existing Django models using a mixin
        
        ## Installation
        
        1. Install the package using pip:
        
        pip install django-model-history-tracker
        
        2. Add `'django_model_history_tracker'` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` in `settings.py`:
        
        ```python
        INSTALLED_APPS = [
            ...
            'django_model_history_tracker',
            ...
        ]
        
        python manage.py migrate
        
        
         ## Usage
        
        To use Django Model History Tracker, simply inherit the HistoryTrackerMixin in any model you want to track:
        
        from django.db import models
        from django_model_history_tracker.mixins import HistoryTrackerMixin
        
        class ExampleModel(HistoryTrackerMixin, models.Model):
            field1 = models.CharField(max_length=100)
            field2 = models.IntegerField()
        
        That's it! Your model will now automatically track changes and store them in the History model.
        
        
        Accessing History
        
        You can access the history of a tracked model instance using the generic relation:
        
        history = example_model_instance.history_set.all()
        
        Each history entry will have the following fields:
        
            action: The action that occurred ('create', 'update', or 'delete')
            timestamp: The timestamp of when the action occurred
            changes: A JSON field containing the changes made to the instance
