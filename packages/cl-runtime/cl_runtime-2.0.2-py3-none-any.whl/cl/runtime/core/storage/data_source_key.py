    Key for the data source record.

    Data source is a logical concept similar to database
    that can be implemented for a document DB, relational DB,
    key-value store, or filesystem. On top of the core
    storage layer, it adds directory-like attribute called
    dataset.

    Data source API provides the ability to:

    (a) store and query datasets;
    (b) store records in a specific dataset; and
    (c) query record across a group of datasets.

    This record is always stored in root dataset.
