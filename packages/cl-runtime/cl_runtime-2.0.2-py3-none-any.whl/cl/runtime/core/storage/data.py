    Base class for serializable data.

    Instances of direct descendants of the Data class can be stored in a
    database as fields of a Record class, but not on their own. Derive
    from Record to enable storing instances directly.

    Derived classes must implement the following methods:

    * to_dict() - serialize self as dictionary
    * from_dict(data_dict) - populate self from dictionary

        The result may be returned using shallow copy. The callers of this method
        must serialize or perform deep copy of the result in case the record fields
        change after this method is invoked.
