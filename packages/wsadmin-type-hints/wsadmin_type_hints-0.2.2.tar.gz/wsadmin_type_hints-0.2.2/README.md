# `wsadmin-type-hints`
Python package providing **type hints** for `wsadmin` **Jython** commands.

This **speeds up** the development of `wsadmin` **Jython** scripts inside an IDE since it provides intellisense on every method of the 5 main objects provided at runtime by the `wsadmin`:
- `AdminControl`
- `AdminConfig`
- `AdminApp`
- `AdminTask`
- `Help`

- **List all module commands** through intellisense:

- Check **parameter and return types**, as well as a brief description of the command (using [Google syntax](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)):

	```
	pip install wsadmin-type-hints
	```

	```
	poetry add wsadmin-type-hints --group dev 
	```

### Usage
Use it like this:
```python
try:
