# Slayer in the Shadows

Our entry to **[PyWeek 35](https://pyweek.org)**.

Note: Unfortunately, we were unable to complete the game. We wanted to add in levels, enemy sprites, and ranged weapons,
but we all got busy with life. However, we still want to show off what we had, and we will still probably work on it and
finish later.

## Installation

To install the game, you need to clone this repo and install the dependencies:

```commandline
git clone https://github.com/letsbuilda/slayer_in_the_shadows.git
cd slayer_in_the_shadows
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> Note: Replace `python` with the proper executable name. On Windows, this is usually `py` and on other systems, it's
> usually `python3`.

Once the dependencies are installed, run the game:

```commandline
python -m run_game
```

## Controls

Jump: W or Space  
Right: D  
Left: A  
Attack: Left click
