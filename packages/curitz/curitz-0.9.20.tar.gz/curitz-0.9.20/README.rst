curitz
======

Python curses package to interface with Zino.

Split from internal project PyRitz on 2023-03-30.

Testing
=======

This library is testable with unittests. When testing it starts a Zino emulator
that reponds correctly to requests as the real server would do.

If you have all currently supported pythons in your path, you can test them
all, with an HTML coverage report placed in ``htmlcov/``::

    tox

To test on a specific python other than current, run::

    tox -e py{version}

where ``version`` is of the form "311" for Python 3.11.

Install
=======

To use ``curitz`` we recommend installing it to your local user, for instance
with ``pip`'s ``--user``-flag::

    pip install --user .

if installing from source or::

    pip install --user curitz

if installing from Pypi. This should normally put the binary and library under
``.local`` on Linux.

Development
===========

Some minimal pre-commit hooks are included, install by running
``pre-commit install``.

See the file `.git-blame-ignore-revs` for commits to ignore when running
`git blame`. Use it like so::

    git blame --ignore-revs-file .git-blame-ignore-revs FILE
