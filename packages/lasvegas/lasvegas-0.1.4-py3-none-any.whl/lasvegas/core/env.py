    Logic is the following: playing a game is following a succession of
    steps. After one step was done -- see `one_step` --, `next_step` is
    updated. It is set to `None` if further information is needed, at
    which point `resume` will stop and `one_step` won't advance.

    New Attributes:
    ---------------
        is_over (bool): Whether or not the game is over.
        max_dice (int): Maximum number of dice of one type that can be
            at the same casino.
        next_step (Callable | None): The next step to be executed. If
            `None`, the game will pause.
        with_xtr (bool): Whether or not the game is played with neutral
            dice.

    New Properties:
