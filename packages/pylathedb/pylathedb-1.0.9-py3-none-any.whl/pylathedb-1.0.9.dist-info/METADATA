# PyLatheDB

**A Python library for Relational Keyword Search with Support to Schema References.**

PyLatheDB is based on Lathe, an R-KwS framework that generalizes the well-known concepts of Query Matches (QMs) and Candidate Joining Networks (CJNs) to handle keywords referring to schema elements and introduces new algorithms to generate them, along with a novel approach to automatically select the CJNs that are more likely to represent the user intent when issuing a keyword query.

We showcase PyLatheDB through a Jupyter Notebook. We recommend running it using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/pr3martins/PyLatheDB/blob/main/demo/PyLatheDB_DEMO.ipynb). But its static version is also available in our repository [here](https://github.com/pr3martins/PyLatheDB/blob/main/demo/PyLatheDB_DEMO.ipynb).

The database source files are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Xz3mPN0NC7xdIETKZlFDTcqcU6lsVUYD?usp=sharing)
