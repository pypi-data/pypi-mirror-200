Miscellaneous git-cola utilities
================================

The [git-cola bash completion script](git-cola-complation.bash) can be sourced
by `.bashrc` or `/etc/bash_completion.d` to provide completion for `git cola`
on the command-line.

The [darwin](darwin) directory contains resources for creating Mac OS X
git-cola.app application bundles.

The [win32](win32) directory contains packaging-related utilities and
resources for the Windows installer.  If you're developing git-cola on
Windows then you can use the `cola` and `dag` helper scripts to launch
git-cola from your source tree without needing to have python.exe in your path.
