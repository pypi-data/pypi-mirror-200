# Fab - A Build System for Tomorrow!

![](https://github.com/Metomi/fab/workflows/Build/badge.svg)

The "Fab" build system aims to provide a quick and easy build process tailored towards a
specific subset of scientific software developers. Quick should be in both use and
operation. Easy should mean the simple things are simple and the complicated things
possible.

The tool is not intended for general use outside its intended domain although you are,
of course, welcome to use it there. Just don't expect high priority to be given to
features which do not target scientific software development.

## Licence

The software is made available under a 3-clause BSD licence.

## Installation

You may simply use `pip install sci-fab`.

## Usage

Although Fab is in its initial development phases right now and much of the
functionality is yet to be added, the command line interface to the tool is 
in place and can be run using the command `fab`
