Description: # dsdn-distrib-20230330-gk package
        
        This is the first package I created as part of the Data Science Nanodegree course I am currently studying at Udacity
        
        There is a parent class called Distibution from which another two classes (Gaussian and Binomial) inherit a few attributes and methods.
        
        For Binomial and Gaussian classes there are some methods for calculating mean and st. dev. as well as plotting some bar charts
        
        #Files
        
        Generaldistribution.py: Contains the parent class (Distribution)
        Gaussiandistribution.py: Contains the class for gaussian distribution. Methods for mean and st.dev available 
        Binomialdistribution.py: Contains the class for binomial distribution. Methods for mean, st.dev and bar charts available
        
        #Installation
        
        The package is available in pypi so you can just use pip install dsdn-distrib-20230330-gk
