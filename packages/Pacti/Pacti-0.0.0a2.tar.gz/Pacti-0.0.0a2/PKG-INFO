Pacti is a Python package for carrying out compositional system analysis and design. Pacti represents components in a
system using assume-guarantee specifications, or contracts. Pacti's capabilities, among others, include the following:

- Obtaining sensible system specifications from the specifications of the constituent subsystems.
- Computing specifications of subsystems that need to be added to a design in order to meet an objective.
- Diagnose incompatibilities when interconnecting components.
