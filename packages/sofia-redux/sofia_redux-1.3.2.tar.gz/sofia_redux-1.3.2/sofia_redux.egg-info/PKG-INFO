SOFIA Redux (`sofia_redux`) contains data processing pipelines and algorithms
for instruments on the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy
(SOFIA).

Currently, the SOFIA instruments supported by this package are the FORCAST
and FLITECAM imaging and spectroscopic instruments, the FIFI-LS integral field
spectrometer, the HAWC+ imaging and polarimetric instrument, and the EXES
high resolution spectrometer.

SOFIA raw and processed data can be accessed from the
`SOFIA archive <https://irsa.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/sofia/>`__.
Archived data may not match the results of data processed
with this pipeline software.  Questions specific to particular data sets
should be directed to the `SOFIA helpdesk <sofia_help@sofia.usra.edu>`__.

SOFIA pipelines are developed internally by the USRA/SOFIA data processing
software team, then are published publicly at the
`SOFIA Redux GitHub project
<https://github.com/SOFIA-USRA/sofia_redux>`__.
Contributions and feedback are welcome via the GitHub project, but
merge requests cannot be directly accepted.  They will be internally reviewed,
and pushed to the public site as needed.

For more information about installing and using this package, see
the `online documentation <https://SOFIA-USRA.github.io/sofia_redux/>`__,
or `docs/install.rst <docs/install.rst>`__ in the source distribution.
