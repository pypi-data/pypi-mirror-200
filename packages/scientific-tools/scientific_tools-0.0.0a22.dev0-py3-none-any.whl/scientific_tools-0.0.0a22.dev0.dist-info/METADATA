# Scientific tools

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/scientific-tools.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/scientific-tools/) [![PyVersion](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/scientific-tools.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/scientific-tools/)

# Project's description
scientific_tools is the Swiss knife for scientists and students who work with python.
This framework is currently in development, but some functionnalities work without any bugs.

# Mathematics

## Solve
The `scientific_tools.mathematics.solve` file can resolve equations with some functions using different algorithm :
- `dichotomy` function search the unique solution of f(x) = 0, where f is an continuous and strictly monotone function.
- `implicit_finite_difference_solver` function can solve a partial differential equation with the implicit finite difference method. The shape of partial differential equation must be Ctt Utt + Ctx Uxt + Cxx Uxx + Cx Ux + Ct Ut + Cu U = Cc.
NB: This solver is experimental !
- `explicit_finite_difference_solver` function can solve the same shape of partial differential equation but with the explicit finite difference method.
NB: This solver is experimental !

# Physics

## Uncertainty
The `scientific_tools.physics.uncertainty` file can calculate uncertainties :
- calculate standard uncertainties with propagation rules
- calculate relative uncertainties with propagation rules
- calculate z-scores (z-core between a value and a reference value & z-score between two value)

## Other files are planned
A lot of other functionnalities are in development.

# Graphics package

## Functions graphs
The `scientific_tools.graphics.function_graphs` file can trace 2D and 3D functions graphs.
It will be able to trace two functions curves in few weeks (in development). 

## Uncertainty graphs
The `scientific_tools.graphics.uncertainty_graphs` file can draw :
- an uncertainty graph with a function, the function plus its uncertainty and the fonction minus its uncertainty.
- experimental values with uncertainties bar.
- a z-score graph : draws the points (or a function) that correspond to z-score and draws the maximum and minimum lines of z-core validity.

## Spectral analysis graphs
The `scientific_tools.graphics.spectral_analysis_graphs` file can draw :
- graphs with amplitudes of Discrete Fourier Transform
- spectral graphs with phases of Discrete Fourier Transform

## Thanks
This framework rely on few others frameworks that are free.
The code is written in Python 3.11 and use :
- numpy
- matplotlib
