This is the Cognite GraphQL Python Generator, `gqlpygen`, which is a CLI for automatically generating Python SDK code
from `.graphql` to interact with Cognite Data Fusion's (CDF) Flexible Data Models (FDM). It also supports other cases,
such as generating `.graphql` from `pydantic` classes.

**[DISCLAIMER!]** This project is in a highly experimental no guarantees are made for consistency between versions. The
project may also become deprecated if the experimentation turns out to be a dead end.
