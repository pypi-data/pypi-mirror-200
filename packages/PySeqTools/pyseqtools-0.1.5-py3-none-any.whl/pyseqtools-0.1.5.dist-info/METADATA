# seq_align_two_vars

## General info
This project is created by Jeffrey Cai under supervised by Nathan Ryan, Professor in Mathematics department of Bucknell University.  
It is used to align sequences with non-uniform varaibales like time or distance. It is based on the idea of Alexandar Murph(https://github.com/cran/sawnuti). We implemented his method in this python package and not only to analysis non-uniform time intervals, but including analysis of more than one varaibles like both time and dis.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* numpy version: 1.22.4
* pandas version: 1.5.0
* matplotlib version: 3.6.0
* networkx version: 3.0
* scipy version: 1.10.0
* sklearn version: 1.2.1

## Data import:
1. use make_sample
2. read in datafile
3. input networks, generate random walk data

## Setup
To run this project, install it locally using pip install:

```
$ pip install seq-align-two-vars
```
