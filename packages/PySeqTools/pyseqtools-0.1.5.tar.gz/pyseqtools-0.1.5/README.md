# seq_align_two_vars

## General info
This project is created by Jeffrey Cai under supervised by Nathan Ryan, Professor in Mathematics department of Bucknell University.  
It is used to align sequences with non-uniform varaibales like time or distance. It is based on the idea of Alexandar Murph(https://github.com/cran/sawnuti). We implemented his method in this python package and not only to analysis non-uniform time intervals, but including analysis of more than one varaibles like both time and dis.
