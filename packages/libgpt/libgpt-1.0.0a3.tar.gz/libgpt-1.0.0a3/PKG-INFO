# libgpt
libgpt is a free, tokenless ChatGPT for Python that uses Chrome (or Chromium) to generate responses based on the input message.
Installation

You can install libgpt with pip by running the following command:

```
pip install libgpt
```
You also need to have Chrome or Chromium installed on your system for this library to work properly.
Usage

After installation, you can import the libgpt class and create a new instance:

```
from libgpt import *
# dont use any parameters
gpt = libgpt()

# set chromedriver
gpt = libgpt(chromedriver='/path/to/chromedriver')

# set chromepath
gpt = libgpt(chromepath="/path/to/chrome")

# set chromepath and chromedriver

gpt = libgpt(chromepath="/path/to/chrome", chromedriver='/path/to/chromedriver')

response = gpt.chat("Who are you?")
print(responce)
```
This will prompt the user to input a message, which will be used as input to the GPT model. The libgpt() function will then return a generated response based on this message.
