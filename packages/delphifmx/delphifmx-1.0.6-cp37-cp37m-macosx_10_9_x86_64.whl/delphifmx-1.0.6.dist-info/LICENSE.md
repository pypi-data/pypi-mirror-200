4.  **GENERAL TERMS THAT APPLY TO COMPILED PROGRAMS AND
    REDISTRIBUTABLES –** Customer may write and compile (including
    byte-code compile) Derivative Works, including any libraries and
    source code included for such purpose with the Licensed Software,
    provided that in no event shall Customer create any Derivative Work
    that is competitive with or offers substantially the same
    functionality as the Licensed Software or any other product or
    software application commercially offered by Embarcadero. Customer
    may reproduce and distribute Derivative Works without additional
    license or fees, subject to all of the conditions in this Agreement.
    The Licensed Software may include Redistributables intended for
    distribution by Customer to the users of Derivative Works.
    Redistributables include, for example, those files identified in the
    accompanying printed or on-line documentation as redistributable
    files or those files preselected for deployment by an install
    utility provided with the Licensed Software (if any).  In any event,
    Redistributables included with the Licensed Software are only those
    files specifically designated as such by Embarcadero.  From time to
    time, Embarcadero may designate other files as Redistributables.
    Customer should refer to the documentation, including any "readme"
    or "deploy" files included with the Licensed Software, for
    additional information. Subject to all of the conditions in this
    Agreement, Customer may reproduce and distribute exact copies of the
    Redistributables, provided that such copies are made from the
    original copy of the Licensed Software or the copy transferred to a
    single hard disk. Copies of Redistributables may only be distributed
    with and for the sole purpose of executing Derivative Works
    permitted under this Agreement. Under no circumstances may any
    copies of Redistributables be distributed separately.  Regardless of
    any modifications which Customer makes and regardless of how
    Customer might compile, link, and/or package Derivative Works, under
    no circumstances may the libraries (including runtime libraries),
    code, Redistributables, and/or other files of the Licensed Software
    (including any portions thereof) be used for developing software
    programs by anyone other than Customer.  Only Customer as the
    licensed user (or the Named User) has the right to use the libraries
    (including runtime libraries), code, Redistributables, or other
    files of the Licensed Software (or any portions thereof) for
    developing programs created with the Licensed Software.  In
    particular, Customer may not share copies of the Redistributables
    with other co-developers.  Customer may not reproduce or distribute
    any Licensed Documentation without Embarcadero's express written
    permission. The license granted in this Agreement for Customer to
    create and distribute Derivative Works and the Redistributables (if
    any) is subject to all of the following conditions:  (i) all copies
    of Derivative Works must bear a valid copyright notice, either
    Customer’s or Embarcadero’s copyright notice that appears on the
    Licensed Software;  (ii) Customer may not remove or alter any
    Embarcadero copyright, trademark, license agreement, or other
    proprietary rights notice contained in any portion of Embarcadero
    libraries, source code, Redistributables or other files that bear
    such a notice; (iii) Embarcadero provides no warranty at all to
    Customer or any other person regarding the Licensed Software, and
    Customer will remain solely responsible to anyone receiving
    Customer’s programs for support, service, upgrades, or technical or
    other assistance, and such recipients will have no right to contact
    Embarcadero for such services or assistance; (iv) Customer will
    indemnify and hold Embarcadero, its related companies and its
    suppliers, harmless from and against any claims or liabilities
    arising out of the use, reproduction or distribution of any
    Derivative Work;  (v) Derivative Works must be written using a
    licensed copy of the Licensed Software;  (vi) Customer programs must
    add primary and substantial functionality, and may not be merely a
    set or subset of any of the libraries (including runtime libraries),
    code, Redistributables or other files of the Software; (vii)
    regardless of any modifications made by Customer and regardless of
    how Customer might compile, link, or package Derivative Works, the
    libraries (including runtime libraries), code, Redistributables,
    and/or other files of the Licensed Software (including any portions
    thereof) may not be used in software programs created by Customer’s
    end users (i.e., users of Customer’s programs) and may not be
    further redistributed by Customer end users; and (viii) Customer may
    not use Embarcadero's or any of its suppliers' names, logos, or
    trademarks to market Derivative Works, except to state that a
    Derivative Work was written using the Licensed Software. The
    Licensed Software might include source code, redistributable files,
    and/or other files provided by a third party vendor (“Third Party
    Software”).  Since use of Third Party Software might be subject to
    license restrictions imposed by the third party vendor, Customer
    should refer to the on-line documentation (if any) provided with
    Third Party Software for any license restrictions imposed by the
    third party vendor.  Any license restrictions imposed by a third
    party vendor are in addition to, not in lieu of, the terms and
    conditions of the Agreement. All Embarcadero libraries, source code,
    Redistributables and other files remain Embarcadero's exclusive
    property.  Regardless of any modifications that Customer may make,
    Customer may not distribute any files (particularly Embarcadero
    source code and other non-executable files) except those that
    Embarcadero has expressly designated as Redistributables.  Nothing
    in the Agreement permits Customer to derive the source code of files
    that Embarcadero has provided to Customer in executable form only,
    or to reproduce, modify, use, or distribute the source code of such
    files.  Source code that Customer generates with an Embarcadero
    source code generator, such as an Application Wizard, is considered
    by Embarcadero to be Customer code. Contact Embarcadero for the
    applicable royalties due and other licensing terms for all other
    uses and/or distribution of the Redistributables.

5.  **PROPRIETARY RIGHTS** – Customer shall not acquire, by virtue of
    this Agreement, any right or license other than as expressly
    provided herein. Customer shall not reproduce the Licensed Material
    or other confidential or proprietary information of Embarcadero,
    except as provided in this Agreement. All proprietary rights in and
    to the Licensed Material, all derivatives, translations,
    modifications, adaptations, improvements, enhancements or
    developments thereof and all confidential or proprietary information
    of Embarcadero, including without limitation, all rights under and
    with respect to patents, copyrights, trademarks and rights under the
    trade secret laws of any jurisdiction shall remain the property of
    Embarcadero or its applicable licensor, whether recognized by or
    perfected under applicable local law. Customer shall promptly notify
    Embarcadero of any infringement of Embarcadero’s proprietary rights
    of which Customer becomes aware.

6.  **NO WARRANTY**

    LICENSED MATERIAL IS PROVIDED ON AN “AS IS” BASIS WITHOUT ANY
    WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. EMBARCADERO MAKES NO WARRANTIES THAT THE USE
    OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL WILL BE ERROR-FREE OR UNINTERRUPTED, OR ANY
    OTHER WARRANTIES, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ANY
    WARRANTIES OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

<li> <u>NO CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES</u> - UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL
    EMBARCADERO OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVES BE LIABLE FOR ANY
    CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR INCIDENTAL
    DAMAGES, WHETHER FORESEEABLE OR UNFORESEEABLE, BASED ON CLAIMS BY
    CUSTOMER OR ANY THIRD PARTY (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, CLAIMS
    FOR LOSS OF DATA, GOODWILL, PROFITS, USE OF MONEY OR USE OF THE
    PRODUCTS, INTERRUPTION IN USE OR AVAILABILITY OF DATA, STOPPAGE OF
    OTHER WORK OR IMPAIRMENT OF OTHER ASSETS), ARISING OUT OF BREACH OF
    EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT, BREACH OF ANY
    INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT, MISREPRESENTATION, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
    LIABILITY IN TORT OR OTHERWISE. IN NO EVENT WILL THE AGGREGATE
    LIABILITY INCURRED IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING BY EMBARCADERO OR ITS
    AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE EXCEED ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS.
</ol>

7. **CONFIDENTIALITY** - Customer acknowledges that the Licensed
    Material incorporates confidential and proprietary information
    developed or acquired by or licensed to Embarcadero and that all
    results of testing of the Licensed Software, whether performed by
    Customer or another third party, are confidential. In no event will
    Customer publish or disclose the results of any testing or
    performance specifications of the Licensed Software without
    Embarcadero’s express prior written consent. Each party shall take
    all reasonable precautions necessary to safeguard the
    confidentiality of all Confidential Information disclosed by the
    other party, including those precautions (i) taken by the disclosing
    party to protect its own Confidential Information and (ii) which the
    disclosing party or its authorized representative may reasonably
    request from time to time. Neither party shall allow the removal or
    defacement of any confidentiality or proprietary notice placed on
    the Confidential Information disclosed by the disclosing party. The
    placement of copyright notices on Confidential Information shall not
    constitute publication or otherwise impair their confidential nature
    of such information. If an unauthorized use or disclosure of the
    disclosing party’s Confidential Information occurs within the
    recipient party’s enterprise, the recipient party will immediately
    notify the disclosing party or its authorized representative and
    take, at recipient party’s expense, all steps which may be available
    to recover such Confidential Information and to prevent its
    subsequent unauthorized use or dissemination.

8.  **TERMINATION** – This Agreement and all licenses granted
    hereunder shall commence upon the Effective date and terminate
    immediately upon the earliest of (i) the date upon which Customer
    violates or breaches any term or condition of this Agreement
    and (ii) the date upon which either party notifies the other party
    of its termination of this Agreement (the “Term”). This Agreement
    will terminate automatically if Customer becomes insolvent, goes or
    is put into receivership or liquidation, makes an arrangement for
    the benefit of his creditors or enters into bankruptcy, suspension
    of payments, moratorium, reorganization or any other proceeding that
    relates to insolvency or protection of creditors’ rights or takes or
    suffers any similar action in consequence of debt. Upon the
    termination of this Agreement for any reason, all rights granted to
    Customer hereunder will cease, and Customer will promptly purge the
    Licensed Software from all of Customer’s computer systems, storage
    media and other files and destroy the Licensed Material and all
    copies thereof.

    thereof, to any country set forth on the U.S. Department of
    Commerce’s list of State Sponsors of Terrorism (currently, Cuba,
    Iran, North Korea, and Syria), including any future changes to the
    government’s list of State Sponsors of Terrorism.

10.  **EQUITABLE RELIEF** – The parties recognize that Sections 5 and
    7 are necessary for the protection of the business and goodwill of
    the parties and are considered by the parties to be reasonable for
    such purpose. The parties agree that any breach of such Sections
    would cause the other party substantial and irreparable damage and
    therefore, in the event of any such breach, in addition to other
    remedies which may be available, the non-breaching party shall have
    the right to seek specific performance and other injunctive and
    equitable relief in a court of law.

11.  **ENFORCEABILITY** - If for any reason a court of competent
    jurisdiction finds any provision of this Agreement, or portion
    thereof, to be unenforceable, void, invalid or illegal, that

    to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this
    Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
