# codetalk

Talk to your code!

**NOTE:** You will need a user token to use this project. Currently these are manually distributed; contact us by getting on the list at [codetalk.ai](https://www.codetalk.ai) and we'll supply you one.

## Setup

1. Make sure you have libmagic installed. On macOS, that's:

    ```
    brew install libmagic
    ```

    On Debian-based Linux, use:

    ```
    apt install libmagic1 libmagic-dev
    ```

3. Run the `codetalk` command.

4. Enter your user token when prompted.

5. You will then be asked which directory to index. This needs to be an absolute path to the root of your codebase.

6. Once indexing is complete you will be ready to chat! There are a few built-in commands, which you can list with `help`.
