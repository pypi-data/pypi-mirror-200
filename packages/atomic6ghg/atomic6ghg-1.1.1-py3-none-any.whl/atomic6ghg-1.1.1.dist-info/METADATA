# atomic6ghg
The Atomic6 GHG package is a library to help Python developers speed development of tools
for calculating estimates of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gas emissions.

Install it from PyPI:

`pip install atomic6ghg`

## Docs
[Read the Docs on GitHub](https://glasmor.github.io/atomic6ghg/)

The `docs` branch of this repository hosts content for and tools supporting creating the static web-site hosted on GitHub.io Pages. Contributions for the documentation web-site must be PR'd against the `docs` branch.

## Example Application
Checkout the [online calculator](https://orion.predix.io/calculator). It uses all the features of `atomic6ghg`.

## History
