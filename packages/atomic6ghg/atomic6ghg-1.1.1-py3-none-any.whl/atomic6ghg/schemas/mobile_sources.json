Example entry is shown in first row (GREEN Italics).  Only enter vehicles owned or leased by your organization on this sheet.  All other vehicle use such as employee commuting or business travel is considered a scope 3 emissions source and should be reported in the corresponding scope 3 sheets. \n - Select \"On-Road\" or \"Non-Road\" from drop down box to determine the Vehicle Types available. \n - Select \"Vehicle Type\" from drop down box (closest type available). \n  - Enter \"Fuel Usage\" in appropriate units (units appear when vehicle type is selected). \n - If mileage or fuel usage is unknown, estimate using approximate fuel economy values (see Reference Table below). \n - Vehicle year and Miles traveled are not necessary for non-road equiment. \n '(B) When using biofuels, typically the biofuel (biodiesel or ethanol) is mixed with a petroleum fuel (diesel or gasoline) for use in vehicles.
