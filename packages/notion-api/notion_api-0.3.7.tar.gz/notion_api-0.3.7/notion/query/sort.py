        A sort is a condition used to order the entries returned from a database query.
        A database query can be sorted by a property and/or timestamp and in a given direction.
        For example,
        a library database can be sorted by the "Name of a book" (i.e. property) and in ascending (i.e. direction).

        Database queries can also be sorted by two or more properties, which is formally called a nested sort.
        The sort object listed first in the nested sort list takes precedence.
