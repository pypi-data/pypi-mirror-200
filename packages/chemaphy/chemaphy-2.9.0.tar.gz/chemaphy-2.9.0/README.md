## Requirments
    1. numpy
    2. trigo
    3. pandas

## How it works?

```bash

    import chemaphy
    from scicalc import Constants
    from scicalc import ProjectileMotion
    from scicalc import LogarithmicFunction

    print(chemaphy.pi.value)
    print(ProjectileMotion.horizontal_range(100,Constants.g_Earth,45))
    print(LogarithmicFunction.log_e(2))
    print(LogarithmicFunction.log_10(2))
```
### Output

```bash
  3.1415
  1020.41 m
  0.693
  0.301
```

# Constants

There are so many constants which we use for scientific calculations such as:\

    1. Plank's Constants
    2. pi
    3. e
    4. gravity on different planets
    5. Mass and Radius of different planets
    6. Rydberg's Constants
    and so on...
