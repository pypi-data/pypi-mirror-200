# BandSOS Coastal Flood Forecasting Platform
Experimented on the Bengal delta in Bangladesh, BanD-SOS aims to establish a pre-operational service for forecasting 
cyclonic flooding and the associated societal risk. This service will have two components: a forecast of the coastal 
flooding hazard in real time that uses a state-of-the-art coupled hydrodynamic-wave modelling platform, and a coupling 
of this forecast with a mapping of the vulnerability of the exposed areas. The project is a collaboration with Bangladesh
Water Development Board (BWDB) - the government engineering organization of Bangladesh which manages the water resource
infrastructure and tasked with providing the flood forecasting to the vast community of Bangladesh.

This repository contains the softwares and scripts necessary for running the BandSOS platform. Please consult the 
[full documentation](https://jamalkhan.me/bandsos-platform) how to setup the bandsos platform in practice.
