## Typing stubs for colorama

This is a PEP 561 type stub package for the `colorama` package. It
can be used by type-checking tools like
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/),
[pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright),
[pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype/),
PyCharm, etc. to check code that uses
`colorama`. The source for this package can be found at
https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/colorama. All fixes for
types and metadata should be contributed there.

See https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md for more details.
This package was generated from typeshed commit `ed915c5cde48329e3d1e597e60c4baee27b7854a`.
