# re-cloud

re_cloud enables you to store and collaborate on reports from different open-source and custom build data apps. (including **[re_data](https://github.com/re-data/re-data)**)

At lof of data apps produce reports in the form of html applications which are very usefull. We believe deploying those reports on your S3 or GCS is quite limiting and we as a data community can do much better ðŸ˜Š
