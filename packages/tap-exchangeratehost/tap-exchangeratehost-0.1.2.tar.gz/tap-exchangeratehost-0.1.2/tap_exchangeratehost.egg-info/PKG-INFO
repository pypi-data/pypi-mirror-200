## About this project

This tap was inspired by [tap-exchangeragesapi](https://github.com/singer-io/tap-exchangeratesapi).
It was developed as a replacement of it after the original data source
(https://exchangeratesapi.io) started to require a signup and access key,
which is not ideal for the first example of singer.io.

Developed by ANELEN and friends. Please check out the ANELEN's
