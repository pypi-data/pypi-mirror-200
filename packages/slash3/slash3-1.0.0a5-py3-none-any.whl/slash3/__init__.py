## Introduction

**Slash3** is a Python package for building and navigating Amazon Web Services
S3 URIs.

## Examples

To construct an S3 URI from its component parts:

```python
from slash3 import S3Uri

S3Uri.to_uri("circus", "images/clowns.jpg")  # s3://circus/images/clowns.jpg
```

To join to a key:

```python
from slash3 import S3Uri

images = S3Uri("s3://circus/") / "images"  # s3://circus/images
clowns = images / "clowns.jpg"  # s3://circus/images/clowns.jpg
```

To append to a key:

```python
from slash3 import S3Uri

staff = S3Uri("s3://circus/") / "staff-"  # s3://circus/staff-
steve = staff + "steve.jpg"  # s3://circus/staff-steve.jpg
penny = staff + "penny.jpg"  # s3://circus/staff-penny.jpg
```

To navigate to a parent path:

```python
from slash3 import S3Uri

steve = S3Uri("s3://circus/images/steve.jpg")
images = steve.parent  # s3://circus/images/
```

To discover a relative path:

```python
from slash3 import S3Uri

steve = S3Uri("s3://circus/images/staff/steve.jpg")
relative = steve.relative_to("s3://circus/images/")  # staff/steve.jpg
```

## Installation

Slash3 requires Python 3.9 or later and can be installed from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/slash3/).

```shell
pip install slash3
```

## Logging

Slash3 respects your root logger configuration. To configure the package's
logger directly, get the logger named "slash3".
