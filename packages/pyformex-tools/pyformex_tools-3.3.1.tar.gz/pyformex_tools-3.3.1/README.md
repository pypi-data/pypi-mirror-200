# pyFormex Tools

This package contains some versatile tools that were taken from the
[pyFormex project](https://pyformex.org).
During two decades of pyFormex development, some tools were created that may
be interesting for a wider community. So we decided to publish these tools
separately to make them easier to install for those not needing the whole
pyFormex framework.

## Available modules

  * path: Defines a class Path that allows objected oriented handling of
          file system paths in the style of Python's pathlib, but more
		  convenient to use because our Path derives from str and can thus
		  be used everywhere a normal str is accepted.
          See also the [documentation](https://www.nongnu.org/pyformex/doc-3.0/ref/path.html#module-path).


## Version

  The first two components of the pyFormex Tools version are always the same as
  the corresponding pyFormex release version. A third component may be added
  to tag subsequent versions of this package.


## License

  pyFormex is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3 or later (GPLv3+)
  and so are these tools.
